String library is a JS/TS library which provides straight-forward, powerful functions for working with the String Object in JavaScript. Although originally builted into JavaScript and can be called by using '' or "", it can also be used with other objects and for other purposes. A TypeScript version will be included in the main library that should available for use automatically.
